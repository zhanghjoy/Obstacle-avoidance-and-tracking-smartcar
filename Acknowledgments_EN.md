As I bring this writing to a close, I am overwhelmed by emotions too profound to capture in a few words.

Wang Xiaobo once said that one's twenties are the golden age of life, filled with boundless possibilities and radiant landscapes. After four years at Xihua University, I find myself deeply resonating with that sentiment.

Back in 2019, when I first arrived at Xihua, I immersed myself in all things novel and unfamiliar, seeking diversion in curiosity. Yet, these pursuits all ended in silence. Lost in idleness and self-indulgence, I drifted through the days—one year passed as if it were but a single day. When exams approached, I would hurriedly memorize textbooks, caring not for the pursuit of knowledge itself, but solely for the scores. Once tests concluded, the books were shelved, untouched again. I naively thought: endure these three or four years, obtain a diploma, enter society, earn a wage, start a family—how delightful that would be.

Looking back now, I can only sigh at such folly.

The following year, the pandemic arrived. Confined at home, my mind grew ever more distant from my studies, each subject passed through with mere perfunctory effort. Though I remained home for nearly a year, the time was wasted, and I gained no learning. When I returned to campus in September, I was unchanged from before.

By the third year, half my university life had slipped away. Suddenly, I realized how far I had strayed from my original intention to learn. I began participating in competitions to broaden my knowledge, though most ended in failure.

When the time came for job applications, I found that although desirable positions were available, they demanded qualifications and abilities I did not possess. After three years of drifting through my studies, I had neither competence nor academic standing. Job prospects slipped through my fingers. I then attempted graduate school entrance exams. After six months of preparation, I failed. Now, as I complete my final thesis, four years have passed—time has flown.

Over these four years, the journey has indeed been beautiful. I encountered souls full of charm and those impossible to reason with; teachers who taught with no spark and others whose eyes gleamed with passion during a single lecture.

Yet, these four years at Xihua are but one chapter in life. Whether they held crashing waves or calm under sunshine and snow, they deserve to be sealed in memory. It is time to gather my things and continue onward. As Zhuangzi wrote: "To moisten each other with spit is not as good as forgetting one another in the rivers and lakes."

Life is a journey against the current. Though the mirror may sorrowfully bid farewell to youth, a dead tree may yet blossom in spring. What matters is to keep forever a thirst for knowledge, a heart of humility, and the habit of quiet self-reflection. Then stride forward with firm steps—for even in old age, one may still see boundless possibilities and radiant light in the world.

I give heartfelt thanks to the people I’ve met and the things I’ve experienced in this golden age. The road ahead is long. I wish you all peace and well-being.

Ah, how many days can we truly call our own beneath this vast sky and earth before our hair turns white? Cicadas sing in the summer heat, shorts are paired with a suit coat. With a sword at the foot of Mount Zhongnan, I buy flowers and carry wine. In the end, it is still the wanderings of youth.
